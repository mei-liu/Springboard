# Mini Projects

This folder contains all the Springboard mini project submissions. Mini projects are small scale projects targeted to practice one of the following: data wrangling, inferential statistics, or machine learning. All of the projects are coded using Python in a Jupyter notebook. 

Each mini project is located in its own labeled folder along with a README describing the purpose and scope of the project. Brief project descriptions along with the corresponding git links are provided in the table below.
