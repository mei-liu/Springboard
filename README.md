# Springboard

This respository contains all my projects for the [Springboard Data Science Career Track](https://www.springboard.com/workshops/data-science-career-track/). Projects are organized into folders that contain a descriptive README, Python notebook, data (if applicable), and written report (if applicable). Brief project descriptions along with the corresponding git links are provided in the following table.
